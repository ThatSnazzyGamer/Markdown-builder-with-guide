# Markdown-builder-with-guide

---
This is a simple web application designed to make writing markdown easier.

This tool is very useful to github users who want easy visual, live feedback of what their readme.md file will look like, before they release it.

---
This application contains some placeholder text which is a small and simple guide to the basics of markdown, using some of the features a github user would use the most.
